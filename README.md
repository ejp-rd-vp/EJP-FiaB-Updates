# EJP-FiaB-Updates
A place to announce updates, security alerts, and patches to the FAIR-in-a-Box modules

The FAIR-in-a-Box pipeline is often updated, for a variety of reasons.  We may become aware of a security issue, we may have added some functionality, or we may have simply patched a bug.  If you click on "Watch->All Activity" you will receive email notifications for any updates added to this repository.

Keeping your FiaB secure and up-to-date is your responsibility!  We will use this alert method to do our best to help you!
